# Stock-analysis
In this challenge, we are editing, or refactoring, the analysis we did in class during the VBA module. We are going to refactor so that looping through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in the VBA module. Then, we will determine whether refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, we will present a written analysis that explains the findings.

## Analysis requirements and work detail:
1. Create a tickerIndex and set to zero
2. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98235755/157303919-aa680be2-2b05-462e-8dac-84f021bc218e.png)

3. Arrays are created for tickers,tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices and tickerEndingPrices. Use the tickerIndex to access the stock ticker for all the variables mentioned.

4. Loop through stock data, reading and storing all of the values from each row: tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices. Appropriate comment to explain the purpose of the codes are added

5. Format the cells in the spreadsheet
7. Compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored scripts.
